### But why?
A fun side project I used to learn Bootstrap, basic Sass, concepts of screen coordinates and offsetting, how JavaScript modularity works (about time) and how painful is scraping web pages with Node.

### Why not using XIVAPI instead of scraping from different websites?
Elastic Search is super convoluted to me. Coming up with the correct filters to bring down the amount of false positives under 100 items per requests took too much time and effort.

### Aren't you reinventing the [*wheel*](https://xivbars.bejezus.com) ?
I found out about that when I was half done..
